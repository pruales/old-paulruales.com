Today, Token Flow lets users create income automation flows.
 Our platform will listen to a users direct deposit wallet for new "paychecks" and run their flow automatically.
  We currently support depositing into Aave to earn yield, token to token swaps on Uniswap, and wallet to wallet transfers.
   Using Token Flow, crypto natives are able to finally automate their finances without coding.
    We plan to eventually support generic triggers and actions that will enable more complex multi-chain automation flows. 
    Additionally, we plan to fully audit our smart contracts and redesign some parts of our system to go more fully on-chain for security.
