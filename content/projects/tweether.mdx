We believe that in the blockchain space, addresses are isolated and there exists a lack of connection between wallets.
 This project aims to solve that by bringing following capabilities for Eth wallets and ENS domains. TweEther (the name of our project) is very much 
 an early prototyping form but it does accomplish many of the key challenges we wanted to overcome. Primarily, users can look up other wallets by
  address or ENS, follow/unfollow them, and can see live transaction data from addresses they follow - all while being completely decentralized.
